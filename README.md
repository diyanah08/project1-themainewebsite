# The Maine's Website
###### Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute – Band Website
This is a website that is designed for the band named “The Maine”. The website highlights the tour dates, media and albums from the band and includes a short excerpt about the band. There is also a section for their social media accounts.

## UX
My goal in the design was for new and old fans of The Maine to be able to keep up with the band’s tour dates as well as get to know the band’s repertoire of albums.
1. As an existing fan, I want to know where the band is touring, so that I can achieve get tickets to see them.
2. As a new fan, I want to know their repertoire of albums, so that I can hear their evolution through the years.
3. As a person doesn’t know the band, I want to know who they are, so that I can decide if they interest me.
4. As a person doesn’t know the band, I want to know their latest songs, so that I can decide if I enjoy their music.

## Technologies
1.	HTML
2.	CSS
3.	Bootstrap (4.3)

## Features
This site uses the starter template in Bootstrap as well as several components from Bootstrap. The HTML and CSS style is then modified to achieve the design of the website.

#### Features Left To Implement
In the future, I would like to be able to:
1.	Disable the model if form is not valid.
2.	Add the proper form to collect email address.
3.	Create a list of tour dates that is able to automatically add in new dates and update once the event is over.
